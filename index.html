                <h3>CPU</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU is the
                central processing unit of the computer. A computer's CPU handles all instructions it receives from
                hardware and
                software running on the computer. As an example, the CPU processed the instructions to use a web browser
                to open and
                display this web page on your computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The CPU was first invented and developed at Intel with the help of Ted Hoff and others in the early
                1970s. The first
                processor released by Intel was the 4004 processor.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the CPU, there are two primary components.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>ALU (arithmetic logic unit)</code> - performs mathematical, logical, and decision operations.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>(control unit)</code>- directs all the processors operations.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>Instruction register and pointer</code> - specifies the location in memory containing the next
                    instruction to be executed by the CPU. When the CPU completes the
                    execution of the current instruction, the next instruction is loaded into the instruction register
                    from the memory
                    location pointed to by the instruction pointer.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>Cache</code> - The CPU never directly accesses RAM. Modern CPUs have one or more layers of
                    cache. The CPU's ability to perform
                    calculations is much faster than the RAM's ability to feed data to the CPU.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>Clock and control unit</code> - All of the CPU components must be synchronized to work
                    together smoothly. The control unit performs this function at a
                    rate determined by the clock speed and is responsible for directing the operations of the other
                    units by using timing
                    signals that extend throughout the CPU.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Motherboard</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                A motherboard is the main circuit board inside a computer that connects the different parts of a computer together. It
                has sockets for the CPU, RAM and expansion cards and it also hooks up to hard drives, disc drives and front panel ports
                with cables and wires.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The motherboard links all the individual parts of a computer together and also, allows the CPU to access and control these separate parts. Other than
                bridging internal components, the motherboard ports also allows you to connect external devices to the computer. Such
                external devices would include the monitor, speakers, headphones, microphone, keyboard, mouse, modem and other USB
                devices.

                <h3>Memory</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Computer memory is any physical device capable of storing information temporarily, like RAM (random
                access memory), or
                permanently, like ROM (read-only memory). Memory devices utilize integrated circuits and are used by
                operating systems,
                software, and hardware.
            </p>

            <p>
                Memory can be either volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory is memory that loses its contents
                when the
                computer or hardware device loses power. Computer RAM is an example of volatile memory. It is why if
                your computer
                freezes or reboots when working on a program, you lose anything that hasn't been saved. Non-volatile
                memory, sometimes
                abbreviated as NVRAM, is memory that keeps its contents even if the power is lost. EPROM is an example
                of non-volatile
                memory.
            </p>

            <p>
                Memory is not disk storage!
                It is very common for new computer users to be confused by what parts in the computer are memory.
                Although both the hard
                drive and RAM are memory, it's more appropriate to refer to RAM as "memory" or "primary memory" and a
                hard drive as
                "storage" or "secondary storage."

            </header>
            <p>
                Power supply is a hardware component of a computer that supplies all other components with power. The
                power supply converts a 110-115
                or 220-230 volt AC (alternating current) into a steady low-voltage DC (direct current) usable by the
                computer and rated
                by the number of watts it generates. The image

                Alternatively referred to as the case . The chassis is the housing that helps protect and organize all
                the components that make up a
                desktop computer. The picture is an empty computer chassis.
